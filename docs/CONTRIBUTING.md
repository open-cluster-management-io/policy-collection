# Contributing Policies
This doc provides instruction on how to contribute policies to the `policy-collection` repo.

You can contribute policies by submitting a pull request (PR) in the `policy-collection` repo. Your PR must be reviewed by the [OWNERS](../OWNERS) of the repo. Contributors own full responsibility for all aspects of secure engineering for their contributions, and need to provide an email address to report security issues found in their contributions.

## Guidelines
View the following requirement list to contribute to the `policy-collection` repo:
* Contributed policies must be added to the [community](../policies/community) folder.
* Policies must be mapped to [NIST.SP.800-53r4](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-53r4.pdf) as this is how policies in this repo are organized. 
* You must provide the policy YAML and documentation that explains what the policies do, and how to use them.
