# Policy Collection
A collection of policy examples for Open Cluster Management

## Repo structure
This repo hosts policies for Open Cluster Management. You can find policies from the following folders:

* [stable](stable) -- Policies in the `stable` folder are supported by [Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management for Kubernetes](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/management/advanced-cluster-management).
* [community](community) -- Policies in the `community` folder are contributed from the open source community. 

## Using GitOps to deploy policies to a cluster

Fork this repository; you will use the forked version of this repo as the target to run the sync against. This is to avoid unintended changes to be applied to your cluster automatically. To get latest policies from the policy-collection repo, you can pull the latest changes from policy-collection to your own repo through a pull request. Any further changes to your repo will automatically be applied to your cluster.

Make sure you have [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/) installed and that you are logged into your hub cluster in terminal.

Run `kubectl create ns policies` to create a "policies" ns on hub. If you prefer to call the namespace something else, you can run `kubectl create ns <custom ns>` instead.

From within this directory in terminal, run `cd deploy` to access the deployment directory, then run `bash ./deploy.sh <url> <path> <namespace>`. The parameters for this command are defined as follows:
- `url`: the url of the target repo to run the sync against. Defaults to https://github.com/open-cluster-management/policy-collection.git.
- `path`: the name of the folder in the policy-collection repo that you'd like to pull policies from. Defaults to `stable`.
- `namespace`: the namespace you'd like to deploy the policies on, which should be the same as the one you created earlier. Defaults to `policies`.
