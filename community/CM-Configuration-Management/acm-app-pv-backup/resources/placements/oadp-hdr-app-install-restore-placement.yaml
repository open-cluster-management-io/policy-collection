# Used by the restore policy
# Update the clusterSelector to match ONLY the clusters set/rules where you want to install OADP
# as defined by the hdr-app-configmap configuration.
# For example, to install OADP on all clusters with label environment=prod use this matchExpressions:
#
#    matchExpressions:
#      - key: environment
#        operator: In
#        values:
#          - prod
