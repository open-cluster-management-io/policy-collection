# Update the clusterSelector to match ONLY the cluster where you want to restore 
# a backup as defined by the hdr-app-configmap restore section.
# For example, to restore the backup on the cluster with label environment=prod use this matchExpressions:
#
#    matchExpressions:
#      - key: environment
#        operator: In
#        values:
#          - prod
