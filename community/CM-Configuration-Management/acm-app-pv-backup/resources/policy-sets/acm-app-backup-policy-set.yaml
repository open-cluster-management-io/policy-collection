# Update the clusterSelector to match ONLY the clusters set/rules where you want to backup 
# the application namespaces defined by the hdr-app-configmap backup setup.
# For example, to backup the application on all clusters with label environment=prod use this matchExpressions:
#
#    matchExpressions:
#      - key: environment
#        operator: In
#        values:
#          - prod
