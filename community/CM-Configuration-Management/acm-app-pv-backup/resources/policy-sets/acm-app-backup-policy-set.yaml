# Update the requiredClusterSelector from the Placement predicates to match ONLY the clusters set/rules  
# where you want to backup the application namespaces defined by the hdr-app-configmap backup setup.
# For example, to backup the application on all clusters with label environment=prod use this matchExpressions:
#
#  predicates:
#    - requiredClusterSelector:
#        labelSelector:
#          matchExpressions:
#            - key: environment
#              operator: In
#              values:
#                - prod
# 
# The clusterSets list from the Placement spec is used to dynamically select a set of managedClusters in one or multiple ManagedClusterSet.
# You can update the Placement clusterSets with the list of ManagedClusterSets to be used in your hub configuration.
# 
# IMPORTANT: You need to create a ManagedClusterSetBinding resource for each of the ManagedClusterSet used by your acm-app-backup-placement Placement.
# For example, if using the default clusterSets, which is set by default, then you must create this resource on the hub,
# in the same namespace with the acm-app-backup-placement Placement:
#
# apiVersion: cluster.open-cluster-management.io/v1beta2
# kind: ManagedClusterSetBinding
# metadata:
#  name: default
#spec:
#  clusterSet: default
