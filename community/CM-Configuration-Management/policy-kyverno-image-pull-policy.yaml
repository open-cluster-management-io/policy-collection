                      By default, images that have already been pulled can be accessed by other
                      Pods without re-pulling them if the name and tag are known. In multi-tenant scenarios,
                      this may be undesirable. This policy mutates all incoming Pods to set their
                      imagePullPolicy to Always. An alternative to the Kubernetes admission controller
                      AlwaysPullImages.
