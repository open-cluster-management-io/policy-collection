### Templatized Policies

The following sample policies demonstrate the use of templatization feature to build flexible policies

Policy  | Description | Prerequisites
------- | ----------- | -------------
[Configure Deployment](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-nginx-deployment-templatized.yaml) | Configures nginx deployment resource customized to the target cluster based on contents of resources on the target managedcluster , template-type: managedcluster, template-functions : fromClusterClaim, fromSecret, eq, if-else | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Configure PodDisrution Budget](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-pod-disruption-budget-templatized.yaml) | Configures a pod disruption budget resource with the   values customized based on whether the target managedcluster is labeled a prod environment, template-type: managedcluster, template-functions : lookup, eq, if-else | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Configure Cluster Info](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-managedclusterinfo-templatized.yaml) | Configures a clusterinfo configmap  which contains information about the target managedcluster e.g. its ocp-version etc , template-type: managedcluster, template-functions : fromClusterClaim | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Configure ClusterAutoScaler](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-autoscaler-templatized.yaml) | Using hub templates configures the ClusterAutoScaler resource with values customized to the target cluster , template-type: hub, template-functions : fromConfigMap, .ManagedClusterName | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Enable Policy If Namespace exists](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-enable-if-ns-exists-templatized.yaml) | Demos enabling  one policy from another based on existence of a namespace, template type: managedcluster, template functions : lookup, ne, toBool | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Enable Policy If EtcdEncryption is set](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-enable-if-etcd-encrypted-templatized.yaml) | Enables one policy from another based on whether etcd encryption is setup, template type: managedcluster, template functions : lookup, ne, toBool | [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)
[Configure SriovNetwork ](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-sriovnetwork-templatized.yaml) | Using hub templates configures the SriovNetwork resource with values customized to the target cluster , template-type: hub, template-functions : fromConfigMap, .ManagedClusterName | [Sriov Network Operator](https://github.com/openshift/sriov-network-operator) , [Go Templates functions](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template)

## Deploying community policies to your cluster
While the policies in the [stable](../stable) folder all have out-of-the-box support installed with Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management, community policies are maintained by the open source community. You might need to deploy extra policy consumers in order for community policies to work as intended. If you are seeing the error `no matches for kind "<resource name>" in version "<group>/<version>"`, you must deploy the CustomResourceDefinition (CRD) for the policy before you create it. If some of the policies in this folder are not behaving properly, you must deploy the corresponding policy consumers to handle them.

### Custom policy controllers
Custom policy controllers are created from forks of the [sample policy controller repo](https://github.com/stolostron/multicloud-operators-policy-controller), and as such the process for deploying them is essentially the same as the process for deploying the sample controller.
- Run the following command on your cluster to install the CRD for the custom policy: `kubectl apply -f <CRD path>`
- Run the following command to set up the operator and service account that runs the controller on your cluster: `kubectl apply -f deploy/`

### Policy consumers on operator hub
Some policy consumers are packaged as [operators](https://coreos.com/operators/) and are available on the [Operator hub](https://operatorhub.io/). These consumers can simply be deployed by creating a policy with child [configuration policies](https://github.com/stolostron/config-policy-controller) to handle the installation. The configuration policies might include the following information:
- A namespace to deploy the operator on, if necessary
- A ClusterServiceVersion with install capabilities to install the operator from the operator hub
- A OperatorGroup
- A Subscription
- The custom resource defined by the consumer to enforce custom policies
  For more specific examples of this method of deploying a policy consumer from the operator hub, see the [Policy to install `cert-manager`](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-cert-manager-operator.yaml) and the [Ansible Automation Platform operator](./CM-Configuration-Management/policy-automation-operator.yaml).

### Other custom policy consumers
Occasionally, policies in this folder might be consumed by controllers that do not fall into either of the two categories previously mentioned. To get the most out of these policies, see the [Security control catalog](#security-control-catalog)
