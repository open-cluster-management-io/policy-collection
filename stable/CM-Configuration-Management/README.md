------- | ----------- | -------------
[Scan your cluster with the E8 (Essential 8) security profile](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-compliance-operator-e8-scan.yaml) | This example creates a ScanSettingBinding that the ComplianceOperator uses to scan the cluster for compliance with the E8 benchmark. | See the [Compliance Operator repository](https://github.com/openshift/compliance-operator) to learn more about the operator. **Note**: The Compliance Operator must be installed to use this policy. See the [Compliance operator policy](../CA-Security-Assessment-and-Authorization/policy-compliance-operator-install.yaml) to install the Compliance Operator with a policy.
[Install Red Hat Gatekeeper Operator policy](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-gatekeeper-operator-downstream.yaml) | Use the Gatekeeper operator policy to install the official and supported version of Gatekeeper on a managed cluster. | See the [Gatekeeper Operator](https://github.com/gatekeeper/gatekeeper-operator).
[policy-namespace](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-namespace.yaml) | Ensures that a namespace exists as specified. |
[policy-pod](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-pod.yaml) | Ensures that a pod exists as specified. |
[policy-zts-cmc](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-zts-cmc.yaml) | This example deploys a replica of \`zts-cmc-deployment\`. | See the [Zettaset README.stable(https://github.com/zettaset/zettaset-public/) to learn more about Zettaset CMC Deployment.
[Scan your cluster with the OpenShift CIS security profile](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-compliance-operator-cis-scan.yaml) | This example creates a ScanSettingBinding that the ComplianceOperator uses to scan the cluster for compliance with the OpenShift CIS benchmark. | See the [Compliance Operator repository](https://github.com/openshift/compliance-operator) to learn more about the operator. **Note**: The Compliance Operator must be installed to use this policy. See the [Compliance operator policy](../CA-Security-Assessment-and-Authorization/policy-compliance-operator-install.yaml) to install the Compliance Operator with a policy.
[Kyverno Generate Network Policies](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-kyverno-add-network-policy.yaml) | Configures a new `NetworkPolicy` resource named `default-deny` which will deny all traffic anytime a new Namespace is created. | See the [Kyverno project](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno). **Note**: Kyverno controller must be installed to use the kyverno policy. See the [Policy to install Kyverno](../../community/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-install-kyverno.yaml) in the community folder.
[Kyverno Generate Quota](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-kyverno-add-quota.yaml) | Configures new `ResourceQuota` and `LimitRange` resources anytime a new Namespace is created. | See the [Kyverno project](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno). **Note**: Kyverno controller must be installed to use the kyverno policy. See the [Policy to install Kyverno](../../community/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-install-kyverno.yaml) in the community folder.
[Kyverno Sync Secrets](../CM-Configuration-Management/policy-kyverno-sync-secrets.yaml) | This policy will copy a Secret called `regcred` which exists in the `default` Namespace to new Namespaces when they are created and it will keep the secret updated with changes. | See the [Kyverno project](https://github.com/kyverno/kyverno). **Note**: Kyverno controller must be installed to use the kyverno policy. See the [Policy to install Kyverno](../../community/CM-Configuration-Management/policy-install-kyverno.yaml) in the community folder.
