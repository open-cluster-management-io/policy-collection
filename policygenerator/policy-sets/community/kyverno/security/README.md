## List of Policies 

Policy                              | Description 
------------------------------------| ----------- 
disallow-scc-runasany               | Using RunAsAny in one of available SCC strategies can be used for privilege escalation and should not be allowed
disallow-host-ports                 | Provides a list of allowed ports in the host network namespace.  Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should be forbidden
disallow-host-network               |  Host network Controls whether the pod may use the host's network namespace. Providing access to the host's network gives the pod access to the host's network devices. Pods with access to the host's network devices can be used to snoop on network activity of other pods on the same node.
disallow-host-ports                 |  Provides a list of allowed ports in the host network namespace. Access to host ports allows potential snooping of network traffic and should be forbidden / minimized.
authorization                       | Prevent users from modifying or deleting default scc
disallow-host-namespaces            | Host namespaces (Process ID namespace, Inter-Process Communication namespace, and network namespace) allow access to shared information and can be used to elevate privileges. Pods should not be allowed access to host namespaces. This policy ensures fields which make use of these host namespaces are unset or set to `false`.
disallow_latest_tag                 | The ':latest' tag is mutable and can lead to unexpected errors if the image changes. A best practice is to use an immutable tag that maps to a specific version of an application Pod. This policy validates that the image specifies a tag and that it is not called `latest`
networking                          | Prevent users from deploying Routes with no https 
require-run-as-non-root-user        | Containers must be required to run as non-root users. This policy ensures `runAsUser` is either unset or set to a number greater than zero.
restrict_automount_sa_token         | Kubernetes automatically mounts ServiceAccount credentials in each Pod. The ServiceAccount may be assigned roles allowing Pods to access API resources. Blocking this ability is an extension of the least privilege best practice and should be followed if Pods do not need to speak to the API server to function. This policy ensures that mounting of these ServiceAccount tokens is blocked.
restrict-binding-clusteradmin       |  The cluster-admin ClusterRole allows any action to be performed on any resource in the cluster and its granting  should This policy prevents binding to the cluster-admin ClusterRole in  RoleBinding or ClusterRoleBinding resources.
restrict-escalation-verbs-roles     |  The verbs `impersonate`, `bind`, and `escalate` may all potentially lead to  privilege escalation and should be tightly controlled. This policy prevents  use of these verbs in Role or ClusterRole resources. In order to  fully implement this control, it is recommended to pair this policy with another which  also prevents use of the wildcard ('*') in the verbs list.
security-context-contraint          |   Disallow the use of the SecurityContextConstraint (SCC) anyuid which allows a pod to run with the UID as declared in the image instead of a random UID
restrict-service-account            |   Users may be able to specify any ServiceAccount which exists in their Namespace without   restrictions. Confining Pods to a list of authorized ServiceAccounts can be useful to   ensure applications in those Pods do not have more privileges than they should.   This policy verifies that in the `staging` Namespace the ServiceAccount being   specified is matched based on the image and name of the container. For example:   'sa-name: ["registry/image-name"]' 
restrict_usergroup_fsgroup_id       |   All processes inside a Pod can be made to run with specific user and groupID   by setting `runAsUser` and `runAsGroup` respectively. `fsGroup` can be specified   to make sure any file created in the volume will have the specified groupID.   This policy validates that these fields are set to the defined values.
