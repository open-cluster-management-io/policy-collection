# OpenShift Plus PolicySet

## Installation

The OpenShift Plus PolicySet contains two `PolicySets` that will be deployed.  The OpenShift Plus PolicySet installs everything onto the Advanced Cluster Management hub cluster.  The Advanced Cluster Security Secured Cluster Services and the Compliance Operator are deployed onto all OpenShift managed clusters.

Prior to applying the `PolicySet`, perform these steps:

1. Create the namespace `policies`: `oc create ns policies`
2. Prepare for Red Hat OpenShift Data Foundation by adding worker nodes for storage described [here](https://red-hat-storage.github.io/ocs-training/training/ocs4/ocs.html#_scale_ocp_cluster_and_add_new_worker_nodes)
3. Create the namespace `openshift-storage`: `oc create ns openshift-storage`
4. Label the storage namespace: `oc label namespace openshift-storage "openshift.io/cluster-monitoring=true"`
5. Policies are installed to the `policies` namespace.  Make sure the placement bindings match this namespace for the hub and other managed clusters.

Apply the policies using the kustomize command or subscribing to a fork of the repository and pointing to this directory.  See 
the details for using the Policy Generator for more information.  The command to run is `kustomize build --enable-alpha-plugins  | oc apply -f -`
